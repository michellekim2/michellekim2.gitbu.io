Webscraper using beautifulsoup library to input text from html articles. Splits into words and counts each instance of a unique word.

Purpose: create a 2 hour deliverable using the beautifulsoup library

Suggested future improvements : use tokenizer, use NLP libraries to perform tasks on inputted texts, update to be able to read non-HTML articles to be read
